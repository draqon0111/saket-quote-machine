# saket-quote-machine
This project, which I call the Daily Wisdom Generator, is a small, focused web application I created to reinforce my skills in Vanilla JavaScript and DOM manipulation. My main goal was simple: build a clean, functional tool that cycles through inspirational quotes with a single button click, proving I can manage dynamic content efficiently.
Saket's Thought for the Day Generator
This is a simple, single-page web application designed to display a random inspirational quote upon user request, demonstrating core JavaScript skills. This project was built to practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and modern CSS utility frameworks.

‚ú® Features
Randomized Content: Displays a new quote from the internal data array on every click.

Twitter Sharing: Allows users to easily tweet the currently displayed quote.

Responsive Design: Styled using Tailwind CSS to look great on desktop and mobile devices.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
HTML5 (Structure)

Vanilla JavaScript (Logic)

Tailwind CSS (Styling)

üí° Potential Future Enhancements
Integrate a third-party API (like a famous quotes API) to pull live data instead of using a static array.

Allow users to submit their own quote using localStorage.
